## 1. Overview

OsteoJP is a Portuguese osteopathy and physiotherapy clinic with locations in Linda-a-Velha, Castelo Branco, and Montemor-o-Novo (opening). Brand pillars: Osteopatia, Fisioterapia, Formação. Reference site: https://osteojp.pt.

The platform replaces two legacy systems — Fisiozero (clinical) and Stylus.pt (scheduling) — with a single multi-tenant application covering scheduling, patient records, clinical forms, invoicing, and payments. The system is multi-tenant from day 1 to support a future licensing path beyond OsteoJP.

The platform is API-first for clinical record ingestion: an external AI partner runs ambient recording → Whisper → LLM and pushes completed clinical reports into a signed endpoint. The platform owns the review queue, state machine, finalization, and immutability of finalized records.

Target launch: end of June 2026.

---

## 2. Hard architecture rules

These are non-negotiable constraints applied across the codebase. Sourced from `CLAUDE.md`.

1. Every domain table has `tenant_id uuid not null`. No exceptions.
2. Every domain table has an RLS policy keyed on the JWT `tenant_id` claim.
3. Service-role queries (migrations, ingestion, jobs) must set `tenant_id` explicitly. Never global.
4. Clinical records use a state machine: `ai_draft` → `under_review` → `finalized`. Finalized records are immutable; changes create addendum versions.
5. Form templates are JSON Schema-driven. Templates are versioned and immutable once referenced by a record.
6. Audit log writes on every clinical record mutation and every permission-sensitive action. No exceptions.
7. PII never appears in logs, error messages, or Sentry events. Sanitize before logging.
8. EU data residency: Supabase EU (Frankfurt), Vercel `fra1`, Resend EU. No US-region resources for stored data.

```

Notes:

- `packages/db/seed/form-templates/` holds JSON Schema seed templates (osteopathy, physiotherapy) authored as one file per `(key, version)` row. Seed loader is TODO; see `packages/db/seed/README.md`.
- `packages/i18n/` is the canonical home for `strings.pt.json` and `strings.en.json`. Population begins once wireframes 3–6 are signed off and the package directory is initialized.
- Tests live next to code: `foo.ts` + `foo.test.ts`.

---

## 5. Data model — high-level

The full schema lives in `packages/db/src/schema.ts`. This section names the V1 tables and explains how they relate, but it is not the schema reference.

### 5.1 Table inventory (V1)

| Table | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `tenants` | Top-level isolation unit. Every domain row belongs to one tenant. |
| `users` | Platform user accounts (staff). Tied to Supabase Auth identities. |
| `roles` | Role definitions per the permission matrix. |
| `locations` | Per-tenant clinic locations (Linda-a-Velha, Castelo Branco, etc.). |
| `services` | Per-tenant service catalogue (treatments offered, pricing). |
| `patients` | Patient records. |
| `appointments` | Scheduled sessions. Linked to patient, practitioner, location, service. |
| `form_templates` | Versioned, JSON Schema-driven clinical form definitions. Immutable once referenced. |
| `clinical_episodes` | A patient's course of treatment for a given complaint. Groups records. |
| `clinical_records` | Individual clinical notes / forms. State machine driven (see §7). |
| `attachments` | Files attached to records (images, scans). Stored in Supabase Storage; row holds the signed-URL handle. |
| `audit_log` | Append-only record of mutations to clinical data and permission-sensitive actions. |
| `invoices` | Issued invoices, tied to InvoiceXpress IDs once issued. |

### 5.2 Relationships (selected)

- `tenants` → `users`, `locations`, `services`, `patients`, `form_templates`, `appointments`, `clinical_episodes`, `clinical_records`, `invoices`, `audit_log` (1-to-many on `tenant_id`)
- `patients` → `clinical_episodes` (1-to-many) → `clinical_records` (1-to-many)
- `appointments` → `clinical_records` (optional 1-to-1, linked when the visit produces a record)
- `clinical_records` → `form_templates` (many-to-1, references a specific `(key, version)`)
- `clinical_records` → `attachments` (1-to-many)
- `invoices` → `appointments` (many-to-many, an invoice can cover multiple sessions)

### 5.3 Money

All monetary values stored as integer cents with currency on the column. Never floats. (Per CLAUDE.md.)

### 5.4 Time

All timestamps stored in UTC. Display layer converts to Europe/Lisbon. (Per CLAUDE.md.)

### 5.5 Form template versioning

`form_templates` rows are keyed by `(key, version)` — e.g. `("osteopathy", "v1")`, `("physiotherapy", "v1")`. A clinical record references a specific template version. Once any record references a template version, that version is immutable. New template revisions ship as `v2`, `v3`, etc. Migration of existing records to new versions is an explicit operation, not implicit.

---

## 6. Permission matrix

Server-enforced. Client-side checks exist for UX but are never the security boundary.

| Action | Admin | Therapist | Receptionist |
|---|---|---|---|
| View any patient | ✓ | ✓ (own only) | ✓ |
| View clinical records | ✓ | ✓ (own patients only) | ✗ |
| Edit clinical records | ✓ | ✓ (own, until finalized) | ✗ |
| Schedule appointments | ✓ | ✓ (own calendar) | ✓ |
| Issue invoices | ✓ | ✗ | ✓ |
| Manage users/roles | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ |
| Tenant settings | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ |

Enforcement model: every API route runs a server-side check via `packages/auth`, and RLS policies on `packages/db` enforce the same constraints at the database layer. Both must pass; one is not sufficient.

---

## 7. Clinical record state machine

Per architecture rule 4, clinical records flow through three states:

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> ai_draft: AI partner ingests
    [*] --> under_review: Therapist creates manually
    ai_draft --> under_review: Therapist opens for review
    under_review --> ai_draft: Reject (back to AI partner)
    under_review --> finalized: Therapist signs
    finalized --> [*]: Immutable
    finalized --> addendum: Addendum version created
    addendum --> finalized: Addendum signed (new immutable version)
```

Rules:

- A record in `ai_draft` is invisible to non-reviewing roles.
- A record in `under_review` is editable by the assigned therapist only (or admin).
- Finalization requires therapist signature. After finalization, the row is immutable at the database level (enforced via constraint + RLS).
- Any change to a finalized record creates a new addendum version. The original is preserved; the addendum is signed independently and chained via a `parent_record_id` reference.
- Every state transition writes to `audit_log` with actor, timestamp, and from/to states.

---

## 8. Auth flow

Supabase Auth issues JWTs containing custom claims for `tenant_id` and `role`. Those claims are propagated into PostgreSQL via Supabase's RLS context, where policies key on them.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    actor User
    participant Web as apps/web (Next.js)
    participant SupaAuth as Supabase Auth
    participant API as API route / Server Action
    participant Auth as packages/auth
    participant DB as PostgreSQL (RLS)

    User->>Web: Submit credentials
    Web->>SupaAuth: signInWithPassword
    SupaAuth-->>Web: JWT (sub, tenant_id, role)
    Web->>Web: Persist session
    User->>Web: Action requiring data
    Web->>API: Request + JWT
    API->>Auth: Verify JWT + permission check
    Auth-->>API: Allow / deny
    API->>DB: Query (JWT context set)
    DB->>DB: RLS evaluates tenant_id + role
    DB-->>API: Rows (filtered)
    API-->>Web: Response
    Web-->>User: Render
```

Notes:

- `supabase-js` is used only for auth flows. Application-layer queries go through Drizzle ORM via `packages/db`.
- JWT verification is centralized in `packages/auth`. Routes do not re-implement verification.
- The permission check in step 5 references the matrix in §6.
- RLS is defense in depth, not the primary check. The server check in step 5 is the primary gate. If the server check is bypassed by bug, RLS still prevents cross-tenant reads.

---

## 9. AI ingestion flow

The AI partner runs an ambient-recording → Whisper → LLM pipeline external to the platform and pushes completed clinical reports into a signed endpoint exposed by `packages/ingestion`. Volume: 10–15 reports per month.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant Partner as AI Partner
    participant Ingest as packages/ingestion endpoint
    participant Validate as JSON Schema validator
    participant DB as PostgreSQL
    participant Queue as Inngest (review queue)
    participant Web as apps/web
    actor Therapist

    Partner->>Ingest: POST signed payload (record + attachments)
    Ingest->>Ingest: Verify signature
    Ingest->>Validate: Validate against form_template version
    Validate-->>Ingest: OK / errors
    Ingest->>DB: Insert clinical_record (state: ai_draft)
    Ingest->>DB: Write audit_log entry
    Ingest->>Queue: Enqueue review notification
    Ingest-->>Partner: 202 Accepted (record_id)
    Queue->>Therapist: Notify (in-app + email)
    Therapist->>Web: Open review queue
    Web->>DB: Fetch ai_draft records (RLS-scoped)
    Therapist->>Web: Open record, edit, finalize
    Web->>DB: Update state ai_draft → under_review → finalized
    Web->>DB: Write audit_log entries
```

Notes:

- Authentication contract between partner and platform is **unresolved** — see §16. CLAUDE.md specifies API key + HMAC; the partner has recommended a service-account bearer token. Decision pending lead + partner sign-off.
- Validation in step 3 uses the JSON Schema in `packages/db/seed/form-templates/` for the referenced `(key, version)`. Records that fail validation are rejected with a structured error response to the partner — no `ai_draft` row is created.
- Records ingested via this path always start in `ai_draft`. They cannot be pushed directly into `under_review` or `finalized`.
- Attachments are uploaded via signed URLs issued by the platform on partner request, never proxied through the Next.js server.
- Per-field `ai_extractable` flags on form templates control which fields the partner is permitted to populate. Fields marked `ai_extractable: false` (including `physiotherapy_v1.private_notes`) reject any partner-supplied value at validation time.

## 10. Background jobs

Inngest schedules and runs background jobs. All job code lives in functions registered with Inngest and triggered by either schedule or event.

| Job | Trigger | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Appointment reminder (48h) | Cron (per appointment) | Send SMS + email 48 hours before appointment. |
| Appointment reminder (24h) | Cron (per appointment) | Send SMS + email 24 hours before appointment. |
| Post-visit thank you | Event (appointment marked complete) | Send post-visit email same day. |
| Post-visit feedback | Cron (+3 days post-appointment) | Send feedback request email. |
| InvoiceXpress retry | Event (invoice issue failure) | Retry with exponential backoff. |
| IfThenPay reconciliation | Cron (hourly) | Reconcile pending payments against IfThenPay API. |
| Review queue notification | Event (ai_draft inserted) | Notify assigned therapist of pending review. |

Notes:

- All jobs operate on a single tenant context — set explicitly per CLAUDE.md rule 3. No global queries.
- Failures are reported to Sentry (PII sanitized per rule 7).
- Per-patient communication preferences (SMS / email / both) are honoured at send time, not job scheduling time.

---

## 11. Integration map

Each external service is wrapped in a module under `packages/integrations`. Application code never calls third-party SDKs directly — all calls go through the wrapper, which centralizes retry, logging (PII-sanitized), and error handling.

| Integration | Purpose | Where invoked |
|---|---|---|
| **InvoiceXpress** | Issue, retrieve, void, list invoices (fatura-recibo format with NIF, fiscal data). | Invoice creation flow; reconciliation jobs. |
| **IfThenPay** | MB (Multibanco reference) and MB Way payment requests + callback handler. | Patient payment flow; reconciliation jobs. |
| **Stripe** | Card payments + webhook handler + refund flow. | Patient payment flow (card option). |
| **Twilio** | SMS sending. PT sender (registered). 160-char GSM-7 compliant per `docs/sms-templates.md`. | Reminder jobs; transactional notifications. |
| **Resend** | Transactional email. EU region. From `[from-address]@osteojp.pt` (pending DNS verification). | Reminder jobs; post-visit jobs; auth flows. |
| **Sentry** | Error tracking. EU region. PII sanitized before send. | All apps. |
| **Supabase Storage** | File storage for attachments (clinical record images, scans). Signed URLs only, never public. | Clinical records; AI ingestion attachments. |

The AI partner is not in `packages/integrations` — it is an *inbound* integration (pushes data to us), and its contract lives in `packages/ingestion`.

```

Notes:

- All services storing OsteoJP data sit inside the EU residency boundary per rule 8.
- Twilio, Stripe, IfThenPay, and InvoiceXpress are outbound only — the platform sends them transactional payloads (SMS, payment requests, invoice records). No clinical data crosses these boundaries.
- The AI partner pushes data inbound into `packages/ingestion`. Their pipeline is external to the platform and outside our control.
- Sentry events are scrubbed of PII before send per rule 7.

## 13. Environments

| Environment | Hostname | Purpose | DB |
|---|---|---|---|
| Local | `localhost:3000` | Developer machines | Local Postgres or Supabase branch |
| PR Preview | Vercel preview URL per PR | Review individual PRs in isolation | Supabase branch per PR (DB branching enabled per mega plan Phase 2) |
| Development | `app-dev.osteojp.pt` | Shared staging | Supabase dev project |
| Production | `app.osteojp.pt` | Live platform | Supabase production project |
| Ingestion API | `api.osteojp.pt` | AI partner ingestion endpoint (production) | Same as production |

CI/CD via GitHub Actions: lint, typecheck, and test run on every PR. Merge to `main` deploys to production. Branch protection on `main` requires PR + 1 approval + status checks.

---

## 14. Coding conventions

Sourced from `CLAUDE.md`.

- Server actions over API routes when possible.
- No `any`. If forced, comment why.
- Database access only through `packages/db`. No raw SQL in app code.
- All dates in UTC in DB, Europe/Lisbon for display.
- Money: integer cents, currency on the column. Never floats.
- File uploads always go through signed URLs; never proxy through the Next.js server.
- Tests live next to code: `foo.ts` + `foo.test.ts`.

Naming:

- Tables: `snake_case`, plural (`patients`, `clinical_records`).
- TS: `camelCase` for variables, `PascalCase` for types and components.
- Routes: `/api/v1/...` with explicit versioning.

---

## 15. Out of scope for V1

Per `CLAUDE.md`. Do not build, ignore in PR reviews.

- Patient portal
- WhatsApp integration
- Mobile app
- Telehealth
- Insurance handling
- Waitlist
- Loyalty / referral programs
- Pilates module
- Formação module
- CID-10 mandatory enforcement (codes captured but not enforced)
- Full historical archive migration (partial migration only — see mega plan Phase 5)

---

## 16. Open questions

Items that need a decision from the lead, the owner, or the AI partner before they're locked in. None of these are blocking V1 scaffolding but each needs resolution before the relevant subsystem is finalized.

1. **AI ingestion authentication contract.** `CLAUDE.md` specifies API key + HMAC. The partner has recommended a service-account bearer token. Decision pending; affects `packages/ingestion` and the partner-side client. Per handoff brief, lead has open clarifying questions with the partner.
2. **Seed loader contract.** `packages/db/seed/README.md` flags the loader as TODO. Until the loader lands, form templates in `packages/db/seed/form-templates/` are source-of-truth files only and are not wired into migrations. Form-template relocation from `docs/draft-form-templates/` is blocked on this.
3. **Per-field `ai_extractable` flag values.** Form templates currently set every flag to `false` pending the AI partner contract. Once the contract is signed, narrative textareas (consultation_reason, relief_aggravation, clinical_history, systems_review.*, treatment_objectives, treatment_plan, observations) will likely flip to `true`. Structured fields (booleans, coordinates, dates) likely stay `false`. `physiotherapy_v1.private_notes` stays `false` permanently and is also enforced via `x-access: private_to_author` (RLS / restricted-column enforcement at db + app layer is a separate open item — lead's domain).
4. **Email format.** PR #20 (appointment reminders) and PR #21 (post-visit) flagged plain-text vs HTML+plain-text as an open decision. Sender display name and reply-to address are also pending.
5. **Resend DNS verification.** `[from-address]@osteojp.pt` is placeholder pending DNS records (SPF, DKIM, DMARC) — DNS access required from the owner per `docs/dns-records-pending.md`.
6. **Twilio PT sender registration.** SMS sender ID "OsteoJP" needs PT registration before SMS templates can ship.
7. **No-show charge policy.** PR #21 flagged whether the no-show email should mention a charge / late-cancellation fee. Owner/lead decision.
8. **Locations table content for Montemor-o-Novo.** Opening date and contacts pending owner confirmation.
