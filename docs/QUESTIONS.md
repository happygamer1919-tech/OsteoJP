## 2026-06-10 — Q1: Local env vars missing, build and e2e gates fail locally (ANSWERED 2026-06-10)

Resolution: owner chose "pull from Vercel". Executed partially. apps/web was
linked to the osteojp-platform Vercel project and `vercel env pull` ran, but
the Vercel development environment contains no variables (only an OIDC token).
All five real vars (Supabase URL and keys, DATABASE_URL) exist in Production
scope only, and production secrets were deliberately NOT pulled to local files
(local e2e would mutate the production clinical DB). apps/portal has no Vercel
project to pull from. Follow-ups opened as Q3 and Q4 below. Original entry:

Context: `pnpm build` fails (portal app, prerender of /auth/login and
/auth/activate: "@supabase/ssr: Your project's URL and API key are required")
and `pnpm test:e2e` fails at Playwright auth setup. Neither `apps/portal` nor
`apps/web` has a `.env.local`. Lint, typecheck, and unit tests pass.

Recommended default: pull development env vars from Vercel
(`vercel env pull .env.local` per linked project) for apps/web and apps/portal.
Production secrets stay in Vercel and Supabase dashboards only.

## 2026-06-10 — Q2: Is docs/mega-plan.md the SPEC? (ANSWERED 2026-06-10)

Resolution: owner confirmed mega-plan IS the spec. docs/mega-plan.md was copied
to docs/SPEC.md (now the single source of truth) and mega-plan.md replaced with
a pointer to avoid divergence. Original entry:

Context: global rules require `docs/SPEC.md` as the source of truth for scope.
This repo has `docs/mega-plan.md` instead, plus a missing `docs/BACKLOG.md`
(tickets appear to live in a task graph referenced by stream letters).

Recommended default: treat `docs/mega-plan.md` as the SPEC and the existing
stream/ticket graph as the backlog; rename or symlink only if the owner wants
strict file-name compliance.

## 2026-06-10 — Q3: How should local dev and e2e environments get credentials? (ANSWERED 2026-06-10)

Resolution: owner chose a separate Supabase project for dev/staging (not
production, not local Docker). Decision: never point local dev or e2e at the
production Supabase instance. A dedicated non-production Supabase project will
be used for Development-scoped env vars in both Vercel projects. The six E2E_*
credentials (admin, therapist, reception email/password pairs) will be added to
the Development environment once the dev Supabase project is created. Until
then, local e2e remains reliant on CI's seeded DB workflow. Original entry:

Context: the Vercel development environment is empty; the only env vars on the
osteojp-platform project are Production-scoped (Supabase URL/keys, DATABASE_URL,
service role key). Pulling production secrets locally is unsafe: `pnpm test:e2e`
creates and mutates data, which would hit the production clinical database.
e2e additionally needs `E2E_ADMIN_EMAIL/PASSWORD`, `E2E_THERAPIST_EMAIL/PASSWORD`,
`E2E_RECEPTION_EMAIL/PASSWORD` plus a seeded database (CI provides this via the
"seeded DB" workflows; local does not).

## 2026-06-10 — Q4: apps/portal has no Vercel project (ANSWERED 2026-06-10)

Resolution: Vercel project created manually by Max (2026-06-10). Project name:
osteojp-portal. Root directory: apps/portal. Team: Ivan_Bong_420's projects
(Hobby). Node.js version set to 22.x. Speed Insights and Web Analytics both
disabled. Three env vars added (all environments, non-sensitive):
  NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://jaxmkwoxjcgzkwxgbayx.supabase.co
  NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<anon key — public, in Vercel dashboard>
  NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://api.osteojp.pt
Production deployment confirmed green at osteojp-portal.vercel.app.
Custom domain patient.osteojp.pt to be wired at go-live. Original entry:

Context: the team has exactly one Vercel project (osteojp-platform, root
directory apps/web). apps/portal cannot pull env vars and has no deployment
target. Portal QA to date appears to have run locally.

## 2026-06-11 — Q5: Migrated clinical records: land as `draft` or `locked`, and do they need a dedicated source tag?

Context: the migration pipeline foundation (branch migration-foundation) can
import historical Fisiozero clinical records as either `draft` or `locked`
(`signed` is excluded: a signature attests review in THIS system and cannot be
carried over). Two owner decisions are pending before the real import runs:

1. Default record_status for migrated history. `locked` makes imported history
   immutable immediately (consistent with "migrated history is never
   rewritten"; the importer already refuses to update an imported clinical
   record on re-runs). `draft` would let therapists edit migrated records,
   which risks silently altering historical clinical data.
2. Provenance tag. record_source currently has `manual | ai_ingested |
   patient`. Migrated records are imported as `manual` for now; provenance is
   fully recoverable via the staging ledger (migration_staging_rows maps every
   imported row back to its Fisiozero source id). Adding a dedicated
   `migrated` enum value would make provenance visible in the UI/queries
   without joining the ledger, at the cost of one more enum migration.

Recommended default: (1) `locked`, (2) keep `manual` + ledger provenance for
V1, add a `migrated` source value only if the UI later needs to badge
migrated records. This touches clinical data retention semantics, so it is
owner-confirmable (CLAUDE.md). Not blocking: the foundation supports both
options; the decision is needed before the first real batch (Phase 5).
