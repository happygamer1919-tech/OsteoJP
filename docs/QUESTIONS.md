## 2026-06-10 — Q1: Local env vars missing, build and e2e gates fail locally (ANSWERED 2026-06-10)

Resolution: owner chose "pull from Vercel". Executed partially. apps/web was
linked to the osteojp-platform Vercel project and `vercel env pull` ran, but
the Vercel development environment contains no variables (only an OIDC token).
All five real vars (Supabase URL and keys, DATABASE_URL) exist in Production
scope only, and production secrets were deliberately NOT pulled to local files
(local e2e would mutate the production clinical DB). apps/portal has no Vercel
project to pull from. Follow-ups opened as Q3 and Q4 below. Original entry:

Context: `pnpm build` fails (portal app, prerender of /auth/login and
/auth/activate: "@supabase/ssr: Your project's URL and API key are required")
and `pnpm test:e2e` fails at Playwright auth setup. Neither `apps/portal` nor
`apps/web` has a `.env.local`. Lint, typecheck, and unit tests pass.

Recommended default: pull development env vars from Vercel
(`vercel env pull .env.local` per linked project) for apps/web and apps/portal.
Production secrets stay in Vercel and Supabase dashboards only.

## 2026-06-10 — Q2: Is docs/mega-plan.md the SPEC? (ANSWERED 2026-06-10)

Resolution: owner confirmed mega-plan IS the spec. docs/mega-plan.md was copied
to docs/SPEC.md (now the single source of truth) and mega-plan.md replaced with
a pointer to avoid divergence. Original entry:

Context: global rules require `docs/SPEC.md` as the source of truth for scope.
This repo has `docs/mega-plan.md` instead, plus a missing `docs/BACKLOG.md`
(tickets appear to live in a task graph referenced by stream letters).

Recommended default: treat `docs/mega-plan.md` as the SPEC and the existing
stream/ticket graph as the backlog; rename or symlink only if the owner wants
strict file-name compliance.

## 2026-06-10 — Q3: How should local dev and e2e environments get credentials? (OPEN)

Context: the Vercel development environment is empty; the only env vars on the
osteojp-platform project are Production-scoped (Supabase URL/keys, DATABASE_URL,
service role key). Pulling production secrets locally is unsafe: `pnpm test:e2e`
creates and mutates data, which would hit the production clinical database.
e2e additionally needs `E2E_ADMIN_EMAIL/PASSWORD`, `E2E_THERAPIST_EMAIL/PASSWORD`,
`E2E_RECEPTION_EMAIL/PASSWORD` plus a seeded database (CI provides this via the
"seeded DB" workflows; local does not).

Recommended default: add Development-scoped env vars to the Vercel project
pointing at a non-production Supabase instance (local `supabase start` stack or
a Supabase branch), including the six E2E_* credentials for seeded test users.
Then `vercel env pull` works as originally intended and both red gates should
go green locally.

## 2026-06-10 — Q4: apps/portal has no Vercel project (OPEN)

Context: the team has exactly one Vercel project (osteojp-platform, root
directory apps/web). apps/portal cannot pull env vars and has no deployment
target. Portal QA to date appears to have run locally.

Recommended default: owner creates a second Vercel project for apps/portal in
the dashboard and applies the human-only "Vercel project setup checklist" from
CLAUDE.md (data preferences off, Node 22.x), then adds Development-scoped
Supabase vars per Q3.
