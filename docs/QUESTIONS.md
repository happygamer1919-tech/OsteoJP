## 2026-06-10 — Q1: Local env vars missing, build and e2e gates fail locally (OPEN)

Context: `pnpm build` fails (portal app, prerender of /auth/login and
/auth/activate: "@supabase/ssr: Your project's URL and API key are required")
and `pnpm test:e2e` fails at Playwright auth setup. Neither `apps/portal` nor
`apps/web` has a `.env.local`. Lint, typecheck, and unit tests pass.

Recommended default: pull development env vars from Vercel
(`vercel env pull .env.local` per linked project) for apps/web and apps/portal.
Production secrets stay in Vercel and Supabase dashboards only.

## 2026-06-10 — Q2: Is docs/mega-plan.md the SPEC? (OPEN)

Context: global rules require `docs/SPEC.md` as the source of truth for scope.
This repo has `docs/mega-plan.md` instead, plus a missing `docs/BACKLOG.md`
(tickets appear to live in a task graph referenced by stream letters).

Recommended default: treat `docs/mega-plan.md` as the SPEC and the existing
stream/ticket graph as the backlog; rename or symlink only if the owner wants
strict file-name compliance.
