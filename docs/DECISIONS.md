# Decisions log

Append-only. Every session appends decisions made and reasoning.

## 2026-06-10 — Workflow setup session

- Added "Definition of done", "Backlog", "RLS verification", "Preview
  verification for PRs", "Human-only setup", and "Environment and secrets"
  sections to root CLAUDE.md.
- Replaced the "flag it and stop" rule for owner-confirmable scope with the
  log-to-QUESTIONS.md, block-ticket, continue protocol.
- Created root script `test:e2e` (`turbo run e2e`) and a turbo `e2e` task so
  the e2e gate is runnable from repo root. Previously only `apps/web` had an
  `e2e` script, so the drafted gate `pnpm test:e2e` did not exist.
- Verified all five gates exist and run: lint PASS, typecheck PASS, test PASS,
  build FAIL (missing Supabase env vars, see QUESTIONS.md Q1), test:e2e FAIL
  (same root cause). Failures pre-exist this change and are environmental.
